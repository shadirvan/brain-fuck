 - awk is more of scripting lang than a command
 - `awk '{command}'` usage: `awk '{print}' data.txt`
 - To print only the first field only(contents inside the first column) use: `awk '{print $1}' data.txt`
 - using `$0` instead of `$1` will print the entire file.
 -  To print only the first and third field we can use `awk '{print $1,$3}' data.txt`
 - as a use case `ls -l` give the details of files inside the directory such as it's permissions, owner, date, time, name,etc
 - if we only want to see the files permissions  and their name we can pipe it to awk: `ls -l | awk '{print $1,$9}'` .
 - awk see the space or tab space as a delimiter by default.
 - `awk '{print $NF}' data.txt` prints what ever the content present in the last field.
 - To change the delimiter to something like : or , use the command : `awk -F':' '{print $7}' /etc/passwd` since contents inside /etc/passwd is seperated by ':'.
