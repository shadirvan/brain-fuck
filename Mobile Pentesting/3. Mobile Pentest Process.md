- Reporting


## Reconnaissance
- Find information about the company
	- Earnings Reports and Press Releases often contain info about the Mobile apps.
- Find the target app on Playstore or Appstore
	- Read reviews
	- Enumerate the developer

## Dynamic Analysis
- Running the app and manipulating it.
	- intercept traffic with proxies like burp and proxyman.
	- dumping memory from applications to check for insecure stored secrets.
	- checking local storage for files created at runtime.
	- Breaking SSL pinning at runtime.
- Dynamic analysis can often result in attacks related to OWASP Top Ten such as SQL injection, XSS, IDOR, etc.
## Reporting
- Executive summary as well as specific vulnerabilities
- write report with both OWASP web and mobile.
- provide criticality and steps to reproduce.
